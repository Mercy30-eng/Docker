## Welcome to the course!
Hello! Glad to see you at the Docker ðŸ™‚ Mini-Course
`Docker` is an incredibly useful tool that you will have to encounter in your work sooner or later.
Our journey begins with an introduction to docker â€“ what it is, why we should study it, and what it consists of.

### Getting Started
- <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/">What is Docker?</a>
>  Docker is an open-source containerization platform by which you can pack your application and all its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container. Containers are light in weight which makes them portable and they are isolated from the underlying infrastructure and from each other container. You can run the docker image as a docker container in any machine where docker is installed without depending on the operating system.
